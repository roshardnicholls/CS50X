sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The runtime exponentially increased as n increased for the random data sets,
but linearly increased for the sorted data sets - O(n^2) vs. O(n)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The runtimes for random, reversed, and sorted data sets trended similarly as n increased.
THe runtimes stayed below 1 s which suggests a runtime of O(n*log(n))

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The runtimes for random, reversed, and sorted data sets trended similarly as n increased.
THe runtimes exponentially increased at n = 50K which suggests a runtime of O(n^2)
